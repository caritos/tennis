// Script to check club membership and match data
console.log('This script would check club data but needs to run in Expo environment');
console.log('');
console.log('To debug this issue, we need to check:');
console.log('1. Are there matches in the database?');
console.log('2. Which clubs have matches recorded?');
console.log('3. Are club members properly associated?');
console.log('');
console.log('The issue appears to be that Mission Bay Tennis Center has 1 member');
console.log('but no matches recorded, which is why rankings are empty.');
console.log('');
console.log('This is actually CORRECT behavior - rankings only show when');
console.log('players have actually played matches in that club.');
console.log('');
console.log('Solutions:');
console.log('1. Record some actual matches for the club');
console.log('2. Add sample matches to seeded data (for demo purposes)');
console.log('3. Check if other clubs have matches and show those instead');
