# Implementation Progress Log

## Issue #3: Core Database & Authentication Setup
**Status**: BLOCKED - Requires Supabase dashboard access
**Priority**: High (MVP Core)

### Problem
This issue requires:
1. Access to Supabase dashboard to create tables
2. Supabase admin permissions to set up RLS policies
3. Environment configuration that I cannot access

### Current State
- ✅ All SQLite schemas are complete and working
- ✅ Authentication is functional with email/password
- ❌ Supabase tables need to be created to match SQLite schema
- ❌ RLS policies need to be implemented for production security

### Recommendation
**Developer needs to:**
1. Access Supabase dashboard
2. Create tables matching SQLite schema in `/database/database.ts`
3. Set up RLS policies as documented
4. Test sync functionality with proper permissions

### Documentation Created
- Complete database schema documentation exists
- RLS policy templates can be provided
- Migration scripts can be generated

## Issue #11: Testing Infrastructure (TDD)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium (Code Quality)

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Enhanced Jest Configuration**: Multi-project setup with coverage thresholds (70%+)
- ✅ **Test Data Factories**: Complete factory system in `/tests/setup/testFactories.ts`

- `/tests/integration/` - Integration tests for business logic
- `/tests/setup/` - Test utilities, factories, and database management

### TDD Compliance
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle documentation and examples
- Test-first approach for new features
- Coverage thresholds enforced (70% across all metrics)

### Result
Production-ready testing infrastructure following TDD best practices.
