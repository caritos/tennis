# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Getting Started

### How do I join a tennis club?
Simply browse clubs near you in the Clubs tab and tap "Join" on any club you'd like to join. All clubs use auto-join - there's no waiting for approval! You can join multiple clubs and will have separate rankings in each one.

### Do I need to be a certain skill level to join?
No! Tennis Club welcomes players of all levels. Our points-based ranking system will place you appropriately after you play a few matches. Most clubs have a mix of recreational and competitive players.

### What information do I need to provide?
Just your real name, email, and phone number. We keep it simple! Your phone number is automatically shared with match partners after you confirm matches to help coordinate meetups.

### Can I use a nickname instead of my real name?
No, we require real names to build trust within the tennis community. This helps create accountability and makes it easier for players to recognize each other at clubs.

## Finding and Playing Matches

### How do I find people to play with?
There are several ways:
- **Looking to Play**: Post when you want to play and others can express interest
- **Challenge Players**: Directly invite specific club members to matches
- **Browse Rankings**: See who's active in your clubs and challenge them

### What happens when I accept a match invitation?
Once you accept:
- The match is immediately confirmed
- Phone numbers are automatically shared between all players
- You'll see a community reminder about honoring your commitment
- You can message other players to coordinate details

### What if someone doesn't show up for our match?
After a scheduled match, you can report no-shows or other poor behavior. Our community reporting system automatically handles these issues:
- 2 reports = Warning notification with guidelines
- 3 reports = 7-day temporary removal from all clubs  
- 4 reports = Permanent ban from the platform

## Rankings and Scoring

### How does the ranking system work?
We use a points-based system that combines both singles and doubles matches:

**Base Points:**
- Win = 100 points
- Game differential bonus = +10 points per game difference
- Upset bonus = +50 points for beating a higher-ranked player

**Examples:**
- 6-0, 6-0 win = 100 + 120 = 220 points
- 7-6, 6-4 win = 100 + 30 = 130 points
- Upset win vs higher player = 100 + games + 50 bonus

**Provisional Rankings:**
- Players with fewer than 5 matches show "P" indicator
- Higher point volatility during provisional period
- Bonus points for beating established players

### How do I record match results?
Any match participant can record results using our honor system:
- Enter the score immediately after playing
- Results count toward rankings instantly
- Any participant can edit if corrections are needed
- No confirmation or dispute process - we trust our community

### Can I edit a match score after it's recorded?
Yes! Any participant in the match can edit the score if there was an error. For singles, both players can edit. For doubles, all four players can make changes. This honor system keeps things simple and fair.

### What if I disagree with a recorded score?
Simply edit the match to the correct score. Our honor system means we trust players to report accurate results. If there are persistent issues with a specific player, you can report them through our community system.

## Community Guidelines

### What behavior is expected from players?
- **Honor commitments**: Show up on time for confirmed matches
- **Be respectful**: Good sportsmanship and courtesy with all players
- **Accurate scoring**: Use the honor system to report true match results
- **Prompt communication**: Respond to invitations and messages quickly

### What can I report another player for?
You can only report players after scheduled matches for:
- **No-shows**: Not appearing for confirmed matches
- **Late cancellations**: Canceling with less than 2 hours notice
- **Unsportsmanlike behavior**: Poor conduct during matches
- **Harassment**: Inappropriate or threatening behavior

### How does the automatic removal system work?
Our system processes reports automatically to maintain community standards:

1. **2 Reports**: Player receives educational warning with community guidelines
2. **3 Reports**: 7-day temporary removal from all tennis clubs
3. **4 Reports**: Permanent ban from the Tennis Club platform

This system is designed to give players a chance to improve while protecting the community from repeat offenders.

### Can I be banned for false reports?
Yes. Filing false or retaliatory reports may result in penalties against your account. The system reviews reports for validity and patterns of abuse.

## Privacy and Safety

### Who can see my information?
- **Club members**: Your name and ranking are visible to other members
- **Match partners**: Phone numbers are automatically shared after match confirmations
- **Public**: Only general app statistics, never personal information

### How is my phone number used?
Your phone number is automatically shared with confirmed match partners to help coordinate meetups. This happens only after you've both committed to playing. You can't opt out of this sharing as it's essential for coordination.

### Can I control my location privacy?
Location is used only to help you discover nearby tennis clubs. You can disable location services in your device settings, but this will limit your ability to find relevant clubs.

### What happens to my data if I delete my account?
- Personal information is removed within 30 days
- Match history may be anonymized and retained for ranking integrity
- Community reports are kept for safety purposes
- You can request complete data deletion by contacting us
