        {

          "question": "What are provisional rankings?",
          "answer": "Provisional rankings are for players with fewer than 5 matches in a club. They're indicated by a '*' symbol and appear at the bottom of the rankings list. This includes:\n• New club members with 0 matches\n• Players with 1-4 matches\n\nOnce you play 5 matches, you'll establish a non-provisional ranking and compete for top positions. Provisional players may see larger ranking changes as the system learns their skill level."
