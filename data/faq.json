        {
          "question": "How do I find someone to play with?",
          "answer": "There are several ways:\n• Check 'Open Invites' in your club to see who's looking for matches\n• Use 'Schedule a Match' to create your own invite\n• View club rankings to find players at your skill level\n• Connect with players after recording matches together"
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between 'Record Match' and 'Schedule a Match'?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How do open invites work?",
          "answer": "When you schedule a match, it creates an open invite visible to all club members. Other players can accept your invite, and you'll be notified when someone wants to play. Invites expire after 7 days."

          "question": "Can I play singles and doubles?",

        },
        {
          "question": "What are the filter options in the Members tab?",
          "answer": "You can filter club members by activity level:\n• **All**: Shows every club member\n• **Active**: Shows members with 3+ matches played (experienced, regular players)\n• **New**: Shows members who joined in the last 30 days (great for welcoming newcomers)\n\nActive members have an 'ACTIVE' badge, and new members have a 'NEW' badge for easy identification."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do the member statistics show?",
          "answer": "Each member's card displays:\n• **Total matches played** in this club\n• **Total wins** in this club\n• **Win rate percentage** calculated from their match history\n• **Color-coded progress bar**: Green (60%+ win rate), Orange (40-59%), Red (<40%)\n• **Join date** when they became a club member\n\nThis helps you find players at your skill level or playing style preference."
        },
        {

          "answer": "The Matches tab provides simple filtering options:\n• **Type**: Filter by match format (All, Singles, or Doubles)\n• **Date**: Filter by time period (All Time, Last Week, or Last Month)\n\nThese filters help you quickly find specific matches or review recent club activity."

      "name": "Rankings and Scoring",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How do rankings work?",
          "answer": "Play Serve uses an advanced ELO rating system that considers both WHO you beat and HOW you beat them:\n\n**Starting Rating**: Everyone begins at 1200 points\n\n**Opponent Strength Matters**:\n• **Beat a stronger player**: Gain more points (up to +40)\n• **Beat a similar player**: Gain moderate points (+20)\n• **Beat a weaker player**: Gain fewer points (+5 minimum)\n\n**Match Scores Matter Too**:\n• **Dominant win (6-0, 6-1)**: Get 150% of normal points\n• **Strong win (6-2, 6-3)**: Get 125% of normal points\n• **Solid win (6-4, 6-4)**: Get 110% of normal points\n• **Close win (7-6, 7-6)**: Get only 75% of normal points\n\n**Example**: Beat a stronger player 6-0, 6-1? You might gain +52 points! Win the same match 7-6, 7-6? You'd only gain +26 points.\n\nThis rewards not just winning, but winning convincingly!"
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does beating stronger players give more points?",
          "answer": "The ELO system rewards competitive challenges:\n• It encourages players to challenge those above their level\n• Prevents 'farming' easy wins against weaker players\n• Creates accurate skill-based rankings\n• Makes upsets exciting and rewarding\n\nThe bigger the rating gap, the more points at stake!"
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens to my ranking if I don't play for a while?",
          "answer": "Your ELO rating stays the same when inactive - you don't lose points for not playing. However:\n• Active players may pass you in the rankings\n• Your first few games back use a higher 'K-factor' for bigger adjustments\n• This helps your rating quickly adjust if your skill has changed"
        },
        {
          "question": "Are singles and doubles ranked separately?",
          "answer": "Currently, both singles and doubles affect your overall ELO rating:\n• Singles matches have full impact on your rating\n• Doubles matches have 50% impact (since wins are shared)\n• This gives you one unified club ranking across all play"
        },
        {
          "question": "What do the rating tiers mean?",
          "answer": "Players are grouped into skill tiers based on ELO rating:\n\n• **Elite** (1600+): Top competitive players 🏆\n• **Advanced** (1400-1599): Strong club players 🥈\n• **Intermediate** (1200-1399): Average club players 🥉\n• **Beginner** (1000-1199): Developing players 🌱\n• **New Player** (<1000): Just starting out 🎾\n\nNew players with fewer than 10 matches see larger rating changes as the system learns their skill level."

        {
          "question": "What if someone doesn't show up for a scheduled match?",
