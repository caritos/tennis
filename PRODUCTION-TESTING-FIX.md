# üîß Production E2E Testing - Fixed!

## Issue Resolved ‚úÖ

The path issue in production testing has been fixed! You can now run production E2E tests using either method:

## Method 1: Simple Test Runner (Recommended)

```bash
# This now works with proper path handling and production warnings
./run-e2e-simple.sh 15-record-match-unregistered-prod
```

**What this does:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Detects it's a production test (by the `-prod` suffix)
- üö® Shows production warning and asks for confirmation
- üìÅ Creates proper production screenshots directory
- üéØ Uses absolute paths to find test files correctly
- üì∏ Saves screenshots in `tests/integration/screenshots/production/`

## Method 2: Full Production Runner

```bash
# The comprehensive production runner (also fixed)
./run-e2e-production.sh
```

## Quick Production Test

**To test your unregistered player feature against production right now:**

### Step 1: Start Production App
```bash
# Start production development server
npm run start:prod
```

### Step 2: Connect Expo Go
1. Open Expo Go in iOS Simulator
2. Connect to localhost:8081
3. Wait for your Tennis app to load with **PRODUCTION data**

### Step 3: Run Test
```bash
# Run the production test (with confirmation prompts)
./run-e2e-simple.sh 15-record-match-unregistered-prod
```

### Step 4: View Results
```bash
# See production screenshots
open tests/integration/screenshots/production/
```

## What Gets Tested ‚úÖ

Your production test will:

1. **Navigate** to your real production clubs
2. **Record Match** using production match recording form
3. **Add Unregistered Player** "Jennifer Smith" to production database
4. **Enter Scores** 6-1, 7-5 (realistic tennis scores)
5. **Save Match** creating real production data
6. **Verify Results** in production Recent Matches and Match History
7. **Update ELO** your real production ELO rating
8. **Capture Screenshots** documenting the entire flow

## Important Notes üö®

**This creates REAL data in production:**
- Real match record with unregistered player
- Your actual ELO rating will change
- Match appears in your real club's statistics
- Data persists after testing

**Perfect for:**
- Pre-release validation
- Critical bug reproduction
- Production readiness verification
