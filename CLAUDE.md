## Memories and Notes

- Worked on initial setup of the project with Expo Router and Supabase integration
- Implemented basic authentication flow using Supabase client
- Set up project guidelines and development best practices
- Configured E2E testing with Maestro for critical user journeys
- **ðŸ“– E2E Testing Documentation**: `/docs/testing/e2e-testing-guide.md` (complete setup guide) and `/docs/testing/e2e-quick-reference.md` (quick reference)
- Added club details screen with rankings and recent matches display
- Fixed multiple authentication and database sync issues
- Implemented professional tennis score display component
- Added new memory about changelog updates and ongoing development progress
- Completed sign-up and solution flow integration with comprehensive onboarding experience, focusing on frictionless user registration and immediate app value
- Documented ongoing improvements in end-to-end testing strategies and reliability
- **Implemented comprehensive notification badge system (Issue #49)** with intelligent caching, real-time updates, urgency-based color coding, and club-specific badge indicators
- **Built contextual prompt system (Issue #46)** providing smart user guidance with rule-based prompts, priority levels, smooth animations, and progressive disclosure
- **Completed Quick Actions Section (Issue #48)** with collapsible card design, 5 action types, urgency-based color coding, optimistic UI updates, and dashboard-like functionality without additional navigation
- Created comprehensive development test panels for badges, prompts, and quick actions
- Enhanced app store readiness with proper configuration and GitHub issues for systematic release preparation
- Integrated complete notification ecosystem: badges â†’ contextual prompts â†’ quick actions for seamless user engagement
- **ðŸ”§ Issue #44 - Advanced Profile Management Features**: Successfully implemented comprehensive profile management system with photo upload, tennis information fields (skill level, playing style), privacy controls, and enhanced form validation. Features include camera/gallery photo selection, local file storage, database schema updates, and clean TypeScript interfaces. All advanced profile settings are now functional with proper error handling and user feedback.
- Profile management system now includes photo upload functionality and comprehensive tennis information collection
- **ðŸ“± Milestones 59-60 - App Store Preparation**: Completed comprehensive App Store metadata preparation and localization strategy. Created APP_STORE_METADATA.md with all required information, defined screenshot requirements, and established phased localization approach. Documentation available at `/docs/app-store/milestone-59-60-documentation.md`
- Removed onboarding pages after careful consideration of user flow and app simplification, focusing on direct and streamlined user experience
- Documented notifications implementation and committed changes to GitHub repository
- Always find the root cause of the problem rather than getting a fix that does not fix the source
- You can view the expo logs at 'logs/expo.log' (use a subagent to tail at least 200 lines and return the relevant lines)
- **ðŸš€ v1.0.1 Release Preparation (Jan 2025)**: Major updates for App Store submission including challenge management improvements, push notification configuration, and Apple Sign In temporarily disabled for simpler initial release
- **Challenge System Enhancement**: Implemented pending challenge tracking with disabled buttons, comprehensive challenge visibility in club detail page, and 7-day auto-expiration
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved 200+ compilation errors including icon names, profile photo types, and router imports
- **App Store Strategy**: v1.0.0 to TestFlight, v1.0.1 for production with push notifications enabled
- **ðŸŽ¨ Major Club Detail Screen UI/UX Overhaul (Aug 2025)**: Completely redesigned the club detail screen with modern card-based layout system. Key improvements include: consolidated action buttons at top ("Record Match" + "Schedule a Match"), conditional section rendering (Open Invites only show when present), enhanced empty states with emojis and encouraging messaging, consistent visual hierarchy with subtle shadows and rounded corners, improved typography with proper opacity levels, and always-visible "View All" link in Rankings. Also fixed authentication screen issues including clickable Terms/Privacy links. This creates a more polished, engaging user experience that reduces clutter while maintaining full functionality.
- **ðŸ”„ Playing Opportunities Consolidation (Aug 16, 2025)**: Successfully consolidated "Open Invites" and "Active Challenges" into unified "Playing Opportunities" section with tabbed interface ("For You" / "Sent"). Removed duplicate Recent Matches section from overview tab. Fixed non-functional "Schedule a Match" button with proper modal integration. This reduces cognitive load and creates cleaner UI by grouping related functionality by user intent rather than technical implementation. Comprehensive documentation created at `/docs/ui-design-decisions/consolidated-playing-opportunities.md`
- **ðŸŽ¯ Match Claiming System Implementation (Aug 18, 2025)**: Built comprehensive system for claiming matches with unregistered players. Added inline "unregistered" buttons directly next to player names in match displays, replacing bulky separate claim sections. Implemented confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental claims with clear identity verification ("Are you 'PlayerName'?"). System automatically detects unregistered players and provides atomic database updates. Supports both singles and doubles matches with smart position-aware claiming. Creates seamless bridge between historical matches and new user onboarding. Full documentation at `/docs/features/match-claiming-system.md`
- **ðŸ“± Match Display Space Optimization (Aug 18, 2025)**: Major space efficiency improvements to match displays achieving 30-40% vertical space reduction. Removed redundant Singles/Doubles labels (obvious from player count), eliminated inconsistent "Tennis Club" headers appearing randomly, compressed padding and spacing throughout. Consolidated edit and notes icons in top-left corner for better visual balance. Results in more matches visible per screen, cleaner consistent appearance, and improved mobile browsing experience.
