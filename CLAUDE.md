- Documented notifications implementation and committed changes to GitHub repository
- Always find the root cause of the problem rather than getting a fix that does not fix the source
- You can view the expo logs at 'logs/expo.log' (use a subagent to tail at least 200 lines and return the relevant lines)
- **ðŸš€ v1.0.1 Release Preparation (Jan 2025)**: Major updates for App Store submission including challenge management improvements, push notification configuration, and Apple Sign In temporarily disabled for simpler initial release
