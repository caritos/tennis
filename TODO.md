## Architecture Notes

Following DHH's "Conceptual Compression" philosophy:
- Local-first with SQLite for instant performance
- Minimal backend complexity with Supabase
- TDD approach for code quality and confidence
- Progressive enhancement from local to cloud features

## Feature Scope Alignment

This TODO list now matches the wireframes created for the tennis club app, including:
- 2-tab navigation (Club, Profile)
- Member ranking system with win percentages
- Challenge system for direct player invitations
- "Looking to Play" posting system
- Court management and selection
- Contact sharing and match coordination
- Comprehensive tennis statistics and match history

## Testing Strategy

### Three Levels of Testing:
1. **Unit Tests (Jest)**: Test business logic, models, and utilities
2. **Integration Tests (Jest + Testing Library)**: Test component interactions and SQLite operations
3. **E2E Tests (Maestro)**: Test complete user flows across the entire app

### Maestro E2E Testing Benefits:
- Tests real user workflows on actual devices/simulators
- Supports both iOS and Android with single test files
- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Accessibility testing built-in
- Can test offline/online scenarios
